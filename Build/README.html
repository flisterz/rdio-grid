<h1 id="rdio-inpired-grid-view">Rdio-inpired grid view</h1>

<p>An attempt to recreate Rdio-style grid view, as you can see on their album grid view.</p>

<p>As you resize the browser (or the desktop app), the album thumbnails and the grid will resize accordingly, but it only resized to a specific value, then it will return to original size with a new column counts. This scenario happens when you make the window smaller or bigger.</p>

<p>(Note: The source requires Hammer app to compile. Build folder contains the built source.)</p>
