Rdio-inpired grid view
=======================

An attempt to recreate Rdio-style grid view, as you can see on their album grid view. 

As you resize the browser (or the desktop app), the album thumbnails and the grid will resize accordingly, but it only resized to a specific value, then it will return to original size with a new column counts. This scenario happens when you make the window smaller or bigger.
